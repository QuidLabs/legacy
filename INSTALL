To build the contracts just follow these simple instructions:

> mkdir -p build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

If your pacience is short and want to build faster, you can

> make -jx

where x is the number of cores you'd like to use for the build

The built contracts will be inside the contracts (build/contracts) directory.


To install, just type

> sudo make install

This will install the contract relevant file into /usr/local. This can be changed with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>.
Alternatively, and best for development, install locally on the build directory

> DESTDIR=. make install

And you'll find clean directories with the relevant contract files in build/usr/local/contracts

That's it...have fun!!!
